# yolov8-adversarial-patch-defense
Implementation of adversarial patch attacks on YOLOv8 in a simulated driving environment, using Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) with spatial transformations for robustness. Evaluates performance degradation under attack and applies Local Gradient Smoothing (LGS) to demonstrate the accuracyâ€“robustness trade-off.
